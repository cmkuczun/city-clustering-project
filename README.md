#### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to aid in relocation or travel when searching for similar locations given a target city. 
For instance, if you traveled to New York and want to find similar cities to travel to in the future, the model will recommend a city such as San Francisco.

#### Overview
This is an analysis of various city attributes for determining patterns in cities in the United States.
The attributes are related to weather, economics, public transportation, employment types, and crime/safety.
We test four clustering methods (t-SNE, K-Means, DBSCAN, Spectral) to find the best method for predicting similar cities given an inputted target city.

#### Future Work
Currently, the tool works by taking user input from the terminal. We would improve on the UI to make it a website for easier portability and distribution to users.
